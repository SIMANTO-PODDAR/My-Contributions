## 1. AI Meal Planning Assistant (Premium Meal Chart)

The **AI Meal Planning Assistant** is an AI-powered feature that generates a personalized meal chart based on the information provided by the user. The user will submit relevant information, which will be processed through an AI API to generate suitable meal suggestions for different times of the day, such as breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner.

## 2. Advertisement (Gym-related Ads)

**Examples:**

* **Run** → Running Shoes, Sportswear, Sports Accessories
* **Yoga** → Yoga Mat, Yoga Block, Yoga Accessories
* **Weight Training** → Dumbbells, Resistance Bands, Gym Gloves
